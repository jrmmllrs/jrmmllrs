## 🚀 About Me

I'm a Software Engineering Intern currently working with React.js and Node.js, focusing on building and improving modern web applications. I developed my skills in Python, Flutter, PHP, Laravel, and Tailwind CSS while studying at Pangasinan State University, where I learned the foundations of software development and how to turn ideas into working solutions.

I'm continuously improving my coding practices and exploring new technologies to grow as a developer who can contribute to real-world projects and team goals.
